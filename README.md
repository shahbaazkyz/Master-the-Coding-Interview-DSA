- _Experience doen't come just from working at another company._
- **Maintain GITHUB graph.**
- **Make your own website.**
- **1 ~ 2 Big projects.**
- Instead of spending time on small little projects spend your time on one or two big projects 
- On those projects you will cover the mostly imortant concepts.
- Recruiter just care about that you build things that are real, big and complicated and you solved hard problems.
- Show those projects on your resume work experience section and mention what you've done in that.
- **Blog Post.** (medium.com)
