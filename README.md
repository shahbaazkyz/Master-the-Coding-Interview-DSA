### Resume Cheetsheet

✅ Use a pre-designed resume template    
✅ Make the resume fit on 1 page   
✅ Include words from job description  
✅ Include company name you are applying to  
✅ Does your first item on your resume reflect what they are looking for?  
✅ Experience titles demonstrate value  
✅ Do you have an online link?  
✅ Remove the word “I”  
✅ No buzzwords describing how great you are  
✅ Are you using Action words?  
✅ Measure everything in terms of impact, don’t just describe your responsibilities  
✅ Technical Knowledge/Skills should include what they are looking for. Only show years if it is impressive  
✅ Include only sections/items that are impressive: Experience, Projects, Education, Technical Skills  
✅ No typos or bad grammar

### What If I Don't Have Enough Experience?

[Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/)

[Medium](https://medium.com/)


- _Experience doen't come just from working at another company._
- **Maintain GITHUB graph.**
- **Make your own website.**
- **1 ~ 2 Big projects.**
- Instead of spending time on small little projects spend your time on one or two big projects 
- On those projects you will cover the mostly imortant concepts.
- Recruiter just care about that you build things that are real, big and complicated and you solved hard problems.
- Show those projects on your resume work experience section and mention what you've done in that.
- **Blog Post.** (medium.com)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Linkedin
- Update the linkedin profile with the skills you have and according to the jobs that you're targetting.
- Include relevant skills and keywords.
- Find a people, connect and message or get referals of those companies in which you want to work.
- Update your linkedin profile after few days when you're searching for a job.

### Email
- Ask people in the company for referral.
- Meet them, or message them, meet people in Meetups
- People love talking about themselve, ask CTOs, lead developers and professionals for a chat in office or coffer & let them know you're interested in getting where they are professionally and _learn from them_.
- The key in above mention point is just not ask him for a job.
- Try to bypass the formalities in application process by trying to get in interview right away.

### Email Sample
Hey $BOB,
I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
$COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
or $ROLE. I’d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?

Thanks,
Yourname
Your website or any public profile link.

### Where To Find Jobs?

- Getting an interview is a number game, for getting a interview you need to apply 50 places.
- Just applying to companies blindly is not a good idea.
- If you have companies you love or you want to work for a specific company and targetting your approach and focus is a lot better more efficient way of spending your time.

### Resources for finding a Job.
[Resources for jobs](resourcesForJobs.html)

### When should you start applying?
- **Now.**
- If you're applying to a job where you check all the requirements check boxes and you know everything then that means you are getting a where job where you already know what to do. _You won't grow in this world._
- A job description is simply a guideline of what type of work you will be doing not what type of work have you done in the past.
- Giving interview use as practice just like with anything.
- Remember, **_IF YOU NEVER ASK, THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS NO._** So start applying now.

### Section Overview
- Most important topics for any Software developer or Engineer.
- Even if you're coding 10 years later from now this is a concept that will be around for a long time.
- That will make truly make you a better developer.
- Without Big-O you cannot encouter Big companies interviews like Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Amazon OR FAANG.
- Big-O and official term is Big-O _asymptomatic analysis_.
- Any coder given enough time can solve a problem. What matters is though how well the problem is solved. And this is where Big-O can help us.
- Big-O can tell us how well a problem is solved.
- WIth Big-O we can distinguish Good code and bad code.
- This topic will come again and again.

### What Is Good Code?

What Is Good Code?

- Readable
- Scalable [Big O]
  - **Question:** How can we measure the good and bad code?
  - **Answer :** Big-O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run.
  - **X-axis:** Elements/Inputs, **y-axis:** Operations
  - Excellent, Good: O(log n), O(1)
  - Fair: O(n)
  - Bad: O(nlog n)
  - Horrible: O(n^2), O(2^n), O(n!)

_When we talk about Big-O and scalability of code we simply mean when we grow bigger and bigger with our input, how much does the algorithm or function slow down. The less it slows down the better it is._

### O(n) (Linear time)

- Linear rate - As our number of inputs increase the number of operations as well.
- **Keep in mind,** Big-O doesn't measure things in **seconds** instead focusing on **how quickly our runtime grows**. By simply using the size of input (n) and compare to the number of operations that increase.
- Scalability means, as things grow larger and larger does it scale?

![](big-o-graph.png)

```javascript
// O(n): Linear time
const fish = ['dory', 'bruce', 'marlin', 'nemo']
const nemo = ['nemo']
const everyone = [
  'dory',
  'bruce',
  'marlin',
  'nemo',
  'gill',
  'bloat',
  'nigel',
  'squirt',
  'darla',
  'hank',
]
const large = new Array(100000).fill('nemo')

const findNemo = (fish) => {
  let t0 = performance.now()
  for (let i = 0; i < fish.length; i++) {
    if (fish[i] === 'nemo') {
      console.log('Found NEMO!')
    }
  }
  let t1 = performance.now()
  console.log('Call to find Nemo took ' + (t1 - t0) + ' milliseconds.')
}

findNemo(large) // O(n) --> linear time
```

### O(1) (Constant time)

- O(1) is Excellent in Complexity chart.
- No matter how much input grows, the number of operations remains same.

![](constant-time.png)

```javascript
// O(1): Constant time
const boxes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const logFirstTwoBoxes = (boxes) => {
  console.log(boxes[0])	// O(1)
  console.log(boxes[1])	// O(1)
}

logFirstTwoBoxes(boxes) // O(2)
```

### Exercise: Big O Calculation

- Assignment takes constant.

```javascript
// What is the Big O of the below function?
// Hint, you may want to go line by line
const funChallenge = (input) => {
  let a = 10 // O(1)
  a = 50 + 3 // O(1)

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    anotherFunction() // O(n)
    let stranger = true // O(n)
    a++ // O(n)
  }
  return a // O(1)
}

// 1 + 1 + 1 + n + n + n
// Big O(3 + 3n)
// O(n)
funChallenge()
```

### Exercise: Big O Calculation 2

```javascript
// What is the Big O of the below function? 
// (Hint, you may want to go line by line)
const anotherFunChallenge = (input) => {
  let a = 5 //O(1)
  let b = 10 //O(1)
  let c = 50 //O(1)
  for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) {
    let x = i + 1 //O(n)
    let y = i + 2 //O(n)
    let z = i + 3 //O(n)
  }
  for (let j = 0; j < input; j++) {
    let p = j * 2 //O(n)
    let q = j * 2 //O(n)
  }
  let whoAmI = "I don't know" //O(1)
}

// Big O(4 + 5n)
// Big O(n)
anotherFunChallenge(5)
```

### Simplifying Big O

Rule Book

1. Worst Case
2. Remove Constants
3. Different terms for inputs
4. Drop Non Dominants
