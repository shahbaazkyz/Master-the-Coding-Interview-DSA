- _Experience doen't come just from working at another company._
- **Maintain GITHUB graph.**
- **Make your own website.**
- **1 ~ 2 Big projects.**
- Instead of spending time on small little projects spend your time on one or two big projects 
- On those projects you will cover the mostly imortant concepts.
- Recruiter just care about that you build things that are real, big and complicated and you solved hard problems.
- Show those projects on your resume work experience section and mention what you've done in that.
- **Blog Post.** (medium.com)

### Email
- Ask people in the company for referral.
- Meet them, or message them, meet people in Meetups
- People love talking about themselve, ask CTOs, lead developers and professionals for a chat in office or coffer & let them know you're interested in getting where they are professionally and _learn from them_.
- The key in above mention point is just not ask him for a job.
- Try to bypass the formalities in application process by trying to get in interview right away.

### Email Sample
Hey $BOB,
I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
$COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
or $ROLE. I’d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?

Thanks,
Yourname

### Where To Find Jobs?

- Getting an interview is a number game, for getting a interview you need to apply 50 places.
- Just applying to companies blindly is not a good idea.
- If you have companies you love or you want to work for a specific company and targetting your approach and focus is a lot better more efficient way of spending your time.

### Resources for finding a Job.
[Resources for jobs](resourcesForJobs.html)

### When should you start applying?
- **Now.**
- If you're applying to a job where you check all the requirements check boxes and you know everything then that means you are getting a where job where you already know what to do. _You won't grow in this world._
- A job description is simply a guideline of what type of work you will be doing not what type of work have you done in the past.
- Giving interview use as practice just like with anything.
- Remember, **_IF YOU NEVER ASK, THE ANSWER IS ALWAY NO._** So start applying now.
